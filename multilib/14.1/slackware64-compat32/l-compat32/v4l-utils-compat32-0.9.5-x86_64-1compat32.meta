v4l-utils-compat32: v4l-utils-compat32 (libraries and utilities for video4linux)
v4l-utils-compat32:
v4l-utils-compat32: libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction
v4l-utils-compat32: layer on top of video4linux2 devices.  The purpose of this (thin)
v4l-utils-compat32: layer is to make it easy for application writers to support a wide
v4l-utils-compat32: variety of devices without having to write separate code for
v4l-utils-compat32: different devices in the same class.  Linux V4L2 and DVB API
v4l-utils-compat32: utilities are also included.

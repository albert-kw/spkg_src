libaio-compat32: libaio-compat32 (asynchronous I/O library)
libaio-compat32:
libaio-compat32: The Linux-native asynchronous I/O facility ("async I/O", or "aio")
libaio-compat32: has a richer API and capability set than the simple POSIX async I/O
libaio-compat32: facility.  This library provides the Linux-native API for async I/O.
libaio-compat32: The POSIX async I/O facility requires this library in order to
libaio-compat32: provide kernel-accelerated async I/O capabilities, as do applications
libaio-compat32: which require the Linux-native async I/O API.

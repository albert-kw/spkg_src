PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
samba-compat32: samba-compat32 (CIFS file and print server)
samba-compat32:
samba-compat32: Samba is a CIFS file and print server for CIFS clients.  It allows
samba-compat32: you to make file space or printers on a Samba host available to CIFS
samba-compat32: clients (such as PCs running Windows).
samba-compat32:
samba-compat32: If you have any Windows file servers, you may be able to replace them
samba-compat32: or supplement them with Samba.  One of Samba's big strengths is
samba-compat32: integration, so you can use it to tie together your Linux hosts and
samba-compat32: Windows PC clients.
samba-compat32: This package contains 32-bit compatibility binaries.

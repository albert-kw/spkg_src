dbus-compat32: dbus-compat32 (D-Bus message bus system)
dbus-compat32:
dbus-compat32: D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware
dbus-compat32: device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per user login
dbus-compat32: session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications).
dbus-compat32: Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message
dbus-compat32: passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate
dbus-compat32: directly (without going through the message bus daemon).

dbus-compat32: This package contains 32-bit compatibility binaries.

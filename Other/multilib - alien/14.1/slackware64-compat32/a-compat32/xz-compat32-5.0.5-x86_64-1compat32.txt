xz-compat32: xz-compat32 (compression utility based on the LZMA algorithm)
xz-compat32:
xz-compat32: LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor
xz-compat32: Pavlov as part of 7-Zip.  It provides high compression ratio while
xz-compat32: keeping the decompression speed fast.  XZ Utils are an attempt to make
xz-compat32: LZMA compression easy to use on free (as in freedom) operating
xz-compat32: systems.
xz-compat32:
xz-compat32: The people most responsible for xz are Igor Pavlov, Ville Koskinen,
xz-compat32: and Lasse Collin.  For more info:  http://tukaani.org/xz/
xz-compat32: This package contains 32-bit compatibility binaries.

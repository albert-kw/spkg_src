PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
bzip2-compat32: bzip2-compat32 (a block-sorting file compressor)
bzip2-compat32:
bzip2-compat32: Bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text
bzip2-compat32: compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
bzip2-compat32: considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-
bzip2-compat32: based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of
bzip2-compat32: statistical compressors.

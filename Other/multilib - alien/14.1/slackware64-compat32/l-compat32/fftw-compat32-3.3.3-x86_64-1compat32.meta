PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
fftw-compat32: fftw-compat32 (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West)
fftw-compat32: 
fftw-compat32: FFTW is a free collection of fast C routines for computing the
fftw-compat32: Discrete Fourier Transform in one or more dimensions.  It includes
fftw-compat32: complex, real, symmetric, and parallel transforms, and can handle
fftw-compat32: arbitrary array sizes efficiently.  FFTW is typically faster than
fftw-compat32: other publicly-available FFT implementations, and is even
fftw-compat32: competitive with vendor-tuned libraries.

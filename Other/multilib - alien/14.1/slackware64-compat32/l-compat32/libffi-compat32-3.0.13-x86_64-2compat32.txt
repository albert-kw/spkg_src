libffi-compat32: libffi-compat32 (A Portable Foreign Function Interface Library)
libffi-compat32:
libffi-compat32: FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function 
libffi-compat32: interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code 
libffi-compat32: written in one language to call code written in another language. 
libffi-compat32: The libffi library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent 
libffi-compat32: layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.

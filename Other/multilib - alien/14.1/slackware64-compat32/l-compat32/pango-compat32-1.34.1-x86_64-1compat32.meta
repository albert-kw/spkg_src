pango-compat32:
pango-compat32: Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
pango-compat32: on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
pango-compat32: is needed; however, most of the work on Pango was done using the GTK+
pango-compat32: widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
pango-compat32: font handling for GTK+-2.

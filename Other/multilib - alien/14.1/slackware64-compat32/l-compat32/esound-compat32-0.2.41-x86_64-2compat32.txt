esound-compat32:
esound-compat32: EsounD, the Enlightened Sound Daemon, is a server process that mixes
esound-compat32: several audio streams for playback by a single audio device. For
esound-compat32: example, if you're listening to music on a CD and you receive a
esound-compat32: sound-related event from ICQ, the two applications won't have to
esound-compat32: jockey for the use of your sound card.  Install esound if you'd like
esound-compat32: to let sound applications share your audio device.

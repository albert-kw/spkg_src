libsamplerate-compat32: libsamplerate-compat32 (a Sample Rate Converter for audio)
libsamplerate-compat32:
libsamplerate-compat32: Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate Converter for
libsamplerate-compat32: audio.  One example of where such a thing would be useful is
libsamplerate-compat32: converting audio from the CD sample rate of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz
libsamplerate-compat32: sample rate used by DAT players.  SRC is capable of arbitrary and time
libsamplerate-compat32: varying conversions.  SRC provides a small set of converters to allow
libsamplerate-compat32: quality to be traded off against computation cost.

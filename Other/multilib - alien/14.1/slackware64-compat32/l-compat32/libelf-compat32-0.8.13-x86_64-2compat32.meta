PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
libelf-compat32: libelf-compat32 (ELF object file access library)
libelf-compat32:
libelf-compat32: Libelf lets you read, modify or create ELF files in an architecture
libelf-compat32: independent way.  The library takes care of size and endian issues,
libelf-compat32: so for example you can process a file for SPARC processors on an
libelf-compat32: Intel based system.  GCC uses libelf for LTO (Link Time Optimization).

libxcb-compat32: libxcb-compat32 (X protocol C-language Binding)
libxcb-compat32:
libxcb-compat32: The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol
libxcb-compat32: which is fully capable of replacing Xlib.  In fact, libX11 makes use
libxcb-compat32: of libxcb as much as possible.  :-)  Porting to XCB has several
libxcb-compat32: advantages such as a smaller memory footprint, latency hiding, direct
libxcb-compat32: protocol access, and improved thread support.
